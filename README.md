This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was created for a coding test with CurrencyFair which required me to take a provided design and 
develop a matching UI.

I began by mapping out some of the components and classes that would be required on top of the 
provided design. That image can be found in the currencyfair-mockup dir. Then I build the basic UI 
without any functionality, get it as accurate as possible, and then add in functionality and things 
like conditional classes. I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
for this project as it creates basic boilerplates for development, testing and styling and saves 
time, so more can be put into the development process. If I had more time, I would've added more 
specific mobile sizes in the CSS instead of a one-size-fits-all solution I currently have 
implemented, and also fixed some of the small design discrepancies that cause the UI to deviate 
slightly from the one provided.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers.<br>
Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).
